# Spoken Language Understanding (Intent Detection and Slot Filling)

Spoken language understanding (SLU) is an emerging field in between the areas of speech processing and natural language processing. The term spoken language understanding has largely been coined for targeted understanding of human speech directed at machines. For natural language inference, the algorithms use the ATIS dataset.

The ATIS dataset is a standard benchmark dataset widely used as an intent classification. ATIS Stands for Airline Travel Information System. Intent classification is an important component of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems in any chatbot platform.
