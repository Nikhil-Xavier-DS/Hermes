# [BERT based Natural Language Inference Models](https://github.com/Nikhil-Xavier-DS/Hermes/tree/master/natural_language_inference/bert_model)
The code is implemented based on the publication, [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). The paper proposes a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.

BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1

BERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so itâ€™s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than the left.

BERT was trained with the masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) objectives. It is efficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation.
