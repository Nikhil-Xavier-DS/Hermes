# Hermes - Deep Natural Language Processing Framework
Hermes is a library built on top of TensorFlow 2 designed to provide simple, abstractions for natural language processing utilizing end to end deep learning models and aggressive modules. Hermes utilizes latest natural language processing algorithm and builds in in TensorFlow entirely or creates a wrapper using Tensorflow. Hermes is a model zoo various NLP algorithms implemented with object-oriented programming for easy encapsulation and understanding. 

Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, in particular, programming computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Deep neural network-style machine learning methods are widespread in natural language processing and can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks. 

Some of the popular NLP tasks implemented in Hermes includes text classification, sentences inference, machine translation.

###### Work in Progress

HERMES was the ancient Greek god of language. One of the cleverest and most mischievous of the Olympian gods, who invented the lyre!
