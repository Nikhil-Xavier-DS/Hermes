# Natural Language Classification
Text classification is the task of assigning a set of predefined categories to sentences. Text classification in Hermes deals with Sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis  is a natural language processing technique used to interpret and classify emotions in subjective data. For sentiment analysis, the algorithms use IMDB dataset.

IMDB is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. It provides a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. 

Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, in particular, programming computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Deep neural network-style machine learning methods are widespread in natural language processing and can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks. 

Some of the popular text classification (sentiment analysis in our case) algorithms implemented in Hermes are explained in brief below.

HERMES was the ancient Greek god of language. One of the cleverest and most mischievous of the Olympian gods, who invented the lyre!
